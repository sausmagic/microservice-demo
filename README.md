Microservice demo application: Microservices version
=================================================

This is a toy application written for demo purposes for the first
Open Reply Technoaperitif, "Introduction to Microservices".

It implements a fake backend for an imaginary TV company, and it's
implemented as microservices carved out of the monolith version.

Being a toy app, I cut me some slack with the best engineering approach
and I took some filthy shortcuts in order to quicken development. Please
understand that and don't copy my practices as they are shown here!:-D
